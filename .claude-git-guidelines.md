# VERSION CONTROL PROCEDURES

## Commit Frequency
- Commit after each functional component is completed
- Commit after significant styling changes
- Commit after bug fixes
- Use atomic commits (one logical change per commit)

## Commit Message Format
- Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Structure: "<type>: <description>"
- Types: feat, fix, style, refactor, docs, test, chore

## Branch Strategy
- main: production-ready code
- develop: integration branch
- feature/<name>: for new features
- bugfix/<name>: for bug fixes

## Git Commands to Use
- New feature: git checkout -b feature/name
- Save work: git add . && git commit -m "type: description"
- Push changes: git push -u origin feature/name
- Pull latest changes: git pull origin main
- Merge completed feature: git checkout main && git merge feature/name
- Push merged changes: git push origin main
- Revert change: git revert <commit-hash>
