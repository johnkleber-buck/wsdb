This project uses a hybrid version control approach:
- Git for technical version control (.git/)
- Project memory for conceptual history (.claude-project-memory.md)
- Version control guidelines (.claude-git-guidelines.md)

When making changes:
1. Always pull latest changes before starting work
2. Create feature branches for new components
3. Make atomic commits with proper messages
4. Update project memory with high-level descriptions
5. Reference Git commits in project memory entries

For remote repository operations:
1. Always pull latest changes before starting work
2. Create feature branches and push to origin
3. Keep the remote repository in sync with local changes
4. After merging, push changes to the remote repository
5. Update project memory after significant pushes
